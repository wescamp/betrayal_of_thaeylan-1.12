1. What is it?
--------------

A two-player campaign for Battle for Wesnoth that will have 12-15 scenarios when complete. Nine scenarios, which form the first of two major story-arcs, are completed in this version.

This scenario is a battle-/army-based campaign similar in some respects to Heir to the Throne. In the beginning, the first player uses predominantly outlaws and the second player uses loyalist units. There are five new player-controlled units integrated in the campaign in its current state:

Level 1		Level 2			Level 3				Level 4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scout 		*Pathfinder 	Wayfarer
NONE		*Field Marshal 	Lieutenant General 	Captain General
Mage		Blue Mage		Tempest
Scrapper	Brawler			Cutthroat
Spearman	Javelineer		Peltast
Torchbearer	Arsonist		Fire Master

* Leader unit


=========================

2. How to play
--------------

Select Multiplayer from the main menu of Battle for Wesnoth. Then browse the list of scenarios on the left and select "Betrayal of Thaeylan". Use all map settings and always load your saved game from this menu.

3. Credits & Thanks
-------------------

Thanks goes first and foremost to the many developers of Battle for Wesnoth, for creating such a malleable game platform. 

All of the scripting is done by me, H-Hour. Most of the spritework for new units is taken either from others or pieced together poorly by me.
