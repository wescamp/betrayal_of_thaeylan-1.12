#	TODO
#	- Herald's arrival: Shroud is cleared but not fog when they speak. Not sure what to do. Other that that it works as intended.
#	-- There may be no villager units left alive, so spawn a torchbearer if we can't find an allied unit
#	- balance was pretty good just a tad too difficult, then too easy after defensive ai in place.
#	-- I've removed just a tiny bit of income from the undead to compensate
#	- Death dialogue for village leaders

It was an arduous journey which gave them time to contemplate the fate which awaited them. Nivyan spoke to the men about the darkness they faced, of the abominations the ancient books describe.
